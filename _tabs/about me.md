Hi! I'm vflame6. I am a cybersecurity student and a penetration tester üë®‚Äçüíª. My goal is to become better in pentesting. In my free time I read books, study or do labs on HackTheBox. 

I'm also interested in programming. I used to code something on Python, Java and Go. I want to start contributing in Open Source projects.

I hope you will enjoy this blog! Let's become better together :)
