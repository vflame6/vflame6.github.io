Hi! I'm vflame6. I am a cybersecurity student and a penetration tester üë®‚Äçüíª. I'm interested in Penetration Testing and Red Teaming exercises. I do these projects starting with communication, preparing the assessment and ending with my report and results presentation. 

Sometimes I write to my blog (EN) [https://vflame6.github.io/](https://vflame6.github.io/) and telegram channel (RU) [https://t.me/vflame6](https://t.me/vflame6).

I hope you will enjoy this blog! Let's become better together :)
