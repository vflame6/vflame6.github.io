Hi! I'm vflame6. I am a cybersecurity student and a junior penetration testerüë®‚Äçüíª. My goal is to become better in pentesting. In my free time I play CTFs, studying on tryhackme.com or doing labs on HackTheBox. I'm also interested in Java programming.

I hope you will enjoy this blog! Let's become better together :)
