My name is Max. I am a student of the SPbSUT, Russia🇷🇺.

I'm a junior penetration tester👨‍💻. My goal is to become better in pentesting. In my free time I play CTFs, studying on tryhackme.com or doing labs on HackTheBox. I'm also interested in Java programming.

I hope you will enjoy this blog! Let's become better together :)
