Hi! I'm vflame6. I am a cybersecurity student and a junior penetration testerüë®‚Äçüíª. My goal is to become better in pentesting. In my free time I play CTFs, studying or doing labs on HackTheBox/TryHackMe. 

I'm also interested in programming. I used to code something on Python, Java and Go. I want to start contributing in Open Source projects.

I hope you will enjoy this blog! Let's become better together :)
